# Click the Dot Game
This is a simple HTML game in which the player needs to click on a red dot as many times as possible in one minute. The dot changes its position every second, and the player needs to click on it every time it changes position. The game was generated entirely using ChatGPT.

Check out the YouTube video [here](https://youtube.com) to see how I generated this project using ChatGPT.

The dot changes its position every second.
Click on the dot every time it changes position.
Each dot can only be clicked once.
After one minute, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
